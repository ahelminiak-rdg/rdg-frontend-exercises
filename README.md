# rdg-frontend-exercises
Series of learning exercises that focus on teaching SASS, component based design, styling tricks, tips and best practices, and simple JQuery functions.

## Project Set Up
1. Open your Terminal Application.
2. Navigate to your Sites directory by typing in the commande `cd Sites` and then hitting enter.
3. Clone the project into your Sites directory by running `git clone https://github.com/ahelminiak-rdg/rdg-frontend-exercises.git`.
4. Navigate to the project by running `cd rdg-frontend-exercises`.
5. Create a new git branch named after yourself (first initial followed by your last name) for your work by running `git branch f_lastname`
6. Install required modules by running `npm i`
7. Start sass by running `npm run sass`
8. Get coding!

## Pushing your work
Once you've completed some work that you'd like to save, you can push your work back out to github. To do this, simply run this command:

`git push`

The first time that you try to push your code, you may see the following message:

```There is no tracking information for the current branch.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
See git-pull(1) for details.

git pull <remote> <branch>

If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote>/<branch> f_lastname```

If that happens, simply run the last command by copying and pasting it into your terminal and pressing enter.

Continue to push your work regularly so you don't lose anything!

## Exercise 4: Accessibility
The accessibility tab has a representative web page for a business. There are known accessibility issues within the HTML and styles. Your job is to identify these issues and resolve them by either changing the HTML or the CSS styles in an accessible way.
